## Description

To see this code in action, go to:

[https://krystan-word-puzzle.herokuapp.com/](https://krystan-word-puzzle.herokuapp.com/)

This website takes a string input by the user and replaces vowels in the string with the dash symbol to create a word puzzle to solve. The resulting word puzzle appears on a new page.

**Example:**

*String Input:* "Believe you can and you're halfway there. Theodore Roosevelt"

*Puzzle Output:* "B-l--v- y-- c-n -nd y--'r- h-lfw-y th-r-. Th--d-r- R--s-v-lt"

On this new page, another user may attempt to guess the solution to the puzzle. A third page reports whether or not the proposed solution is correct.

## Setup
